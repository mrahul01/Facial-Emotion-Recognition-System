# 🎭 Facial Emotion Recognition System

A deep learning–based real-time facial emotion recognition system built using **TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
The model is trained on the **FER2013 dataset** to classify facial expressions into multiple emotion categories and perform live emotion detection using a webcam.
